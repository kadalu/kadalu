= Mounted Block Volumes

For some workloads, using File Volume may not be performant. Kadalu provides an option to use block volume(PV) but as mounted Volume.

Create a new Storage Class with `pv_type: Block` so that Provisioner creates Block PV.

[source,yaml]
----
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: kadalu.db
provisioner: kadalu
parameters:
  storage_name: "storage-pool-1"
  pv_type: Block
----

Above Storage Class adds filter for Storage pool name `storage-pool-1`. All the Persistent Volume claims using this Storage class will be processed as Block Volumes. Refer link:./storage-classes.adoc[Storage Classes] documentation for using more options.

Virtual Block PVs will be formatted using `mkfs.xfs` command.

*NOTE*: Only `ReadWriteOnce` access mode is allowed while using this Storage Class.
