= Storage Classes

From https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/[kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes]

> A StorageClass provides a way for administrators to describe the
> “classes” of storage they offer. Different classes might map to
> quality-of-service levels, or to backup policies, or to arbitrary
> policies determined by the cluster administrators. Kubernetes itself
> is unopinionated about what classes represent. This concept is
> sometimes called “profiles” in other storage systems.

Kadalu provides a few storage classes by default, but users are not
limited to only these classes. This document helps to understand the
default available storage classes and how to create new ones for your
requirements.
