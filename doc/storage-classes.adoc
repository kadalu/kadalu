# Storage Classes

From [kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/)

> A StorageClass provides a way for administrators to describe the
> “classes” of storage they offer. Different classes might map to
> quality-of-service levels, or to backup policies, or to arbitrary
> policies determined by the cluster administrators. Kubernetes itself
> is unopinionated about what classes represent. This concept is
> sometimes called “profiles” in other storage systems.

Kadalu provides a few storage classes by default, but users are not
limited to only these classes. This document helps to understand the
default available storage classes and how to create new ones for your
requirements.

## kadalu

On using this Storage class, Kadalu can provision PVs from any of the
available volumes without applying any filters.

Example PVC,

```
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: pv1
spec:
  storageClassName: kadalu
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

## kadalu.replica1

On using this Storage class, Kadalu will provision PVs only from
Replica 1 Storage pools across the Cluster. Use this option when high
availability is provided by the application and not required from the
Storage.

Example PVC,

```
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: pv2
spec:
  storageClassName: kadalu.replica1
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

## kadalu.replica2

On using this Storage class, Kadalu will provision PVs only from
Replica 2 Storage pools across the Cluster. Replica 2 Storage pools
use Tiebreaker to avoid Split-brain.

Example PVC,

```
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: pv3
spec:
  storageClassName: kadalu.replica2
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

## kadalu.replica3

On using this Storage class, Kadalu will provision PVs only from
Replica 3 Storage pools across the Cluster. Use this Storage class
when PVs require high availability.

Example PVC,

```
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: pv4
spec:
  storageClassName: kadalu.replica3
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

## How to Create a custom Storage Class?

The following filters are available. Use any of the filters to create
a new Storage class.


### storage_name

Specify the name of the Storage pool from which PVs need to
provision.

Example Storage Class

```
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: kadalu.fast-storage
provisioner: kadalu
parameters:
  storage_name: "storage-pool-1"
```

And the PVC,

```
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: pv5
spec:
  storageClassName: kadalu.fast-storage
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

### node_affinity

Use this option if a PV needs to provision from the locally available
Storage, This Storage Class behaves the same as local Storage but with
the support for dynamic provisioning.

Example Storage Class

```
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: kadalu.local-kube1
provisioner: kadalu
parameters:
  node_affinity: "kube1"  # Node name as shown in `kubectl get nodes`
```

And the PVC,

```
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: pv6
spec:
  storageClassName: kadalu.local-kube1
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```


### storage_type

Specify the name of the Storage pool type from which PVs need to
provision. By default, Kadalu provides Storage Class for all supported
Storage types.

Example Storage Class

```
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: kadalu.replica2
provisioner: kadalu
parameters:
  storage_type: "Replica2"
```

And the PVC,

```
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: pv7
spec:
  storageClassName: kadalu.replica2
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

The number of customization a Storage Class can provide is
impressive. The only limit is your imagination. Please open a new
[issue](https://github.com/kadalu/kadalu/issues) if your use case
needs more filters than the ones listed above.
