= Release management

== From github UI

This is the approach kadalu team is using for release. This can be done by
just creating a 'Release' in UI. It will trigger the script from github
actions, and it will create all relevant scripts in the corresponding
folder in github.

Check the [Release URL here](https://github.com/kadalu/kadalu/releases)

== From the Makefile

1. Update CHANGELOG.md file with the list of changes and link
2. Run `make release` to generate Operator manifest file and build
   Containers for a specific version(and latest). Built Containers
   will be published to dockerhub.
+
[source,console]
----
TWINE_PASSWORD=<secret> KADALU_VERSION=0.4.0 make release
----
+
**Note**: If `DOCKER_USER` is specified then it will publish the built
Containers to respective Dockerhub account.
+
[source,console]
----
DOCKER_USER=aravindavk KADALU_VERSION=0.7.0 make release
----

3. Send the PR with manifest file and CHANGELOG.md file changes
4. Create a new Github release - [https://github.com/kadalu/kadalu/releases/new](https://github.com/kadalu/kadalu/releases/new). In the
   release notes, update the Operator manifest file link as,
+
----
https://github.com/kadalu/kadalu/releases/latest/download/kadalu-operator.yaml
----
+
For example,
+
----
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kadalu/kadalu/releases/latest/download/kadalu-operator.yaml
----
