# Currently this pod is neither a part of production deployment nor used in CI.
# Only used for manually debugging KaDalu CSI Driver

# Once this pod is deployed you can run below for communicating with CSI driver
# In one prompt: `kubectl port-forward pods/csi-driver-debug :10000`
# In other prompt: `while true; do nc -vz 127.0.0.1 <port_from_above_op>; sleep 10; done` to keep port-forward alive

# For communicating to CSI Driver you can use either https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl or
# more specific to CSI https://github.com/rexray/gocsi/tree/master/csc
