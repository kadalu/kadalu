## What is Kadalu ?

[Kadalu](https://kadalu.io) is a project which started as an idea to make glusterfs's deployment and management simpler in kubernetes. The project contains operator to deploy CSI pods, and gluster storage nodes. All of gluster management is done natively in kubernetes without glusterfs's `glusterd` and `gluster` CLI tools.

Try it in few minutes to understand more!

## Documentation

Start with our [Quick Start Guide](doc/quick-start.adoc). More documentation is at [`doc/` folder](doc/).

If you made some errors in setup, and want to start fresh, check this [cleanup script](extras/scripts/cleanup), and run it to remove kadalu namespace completely.

Links to blogs and news updates are provided in [our website](https://kadalu.io).

## Helm support

`helm install kadalu --namespace kadalu --create-namespace https://github.com/kadalu/kadalu/releases/latest/download/kadalu-helm-chart.tgz --set-string kubernetesDistro=$K8S_DIST`

Where `K8S_DIST` can be one of below values:
- kubernetes
- openshift
- rke
- microk8s

If `--set-string` isn't supplied `kubernetes` will be used as default.

NOTE: We are still evolving with Helm chart based development, and happy to get contributions on the same.


## Platform supports

We support x86_64 (amd64) by default (all releases, `devel` and `latest` tags), and in release 0.7.7 tag arm64 and arm/v7 is supported. If you want to try arm64 or arm/v7 in latest form try below command to start the operator

`kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kadalu/kadalu/arm/manifests/kadalu-operator.yaml`

For any other platforms, we need users to confirm it works by building images locally. Once it works, we can include it in our automated scripts. You can confirm the build by command `make release` after checkout of the repository in the respective platform.
