## How to contribute

You are encouraged to contribute to the repository by **forking and submitting a pull request**.

(If you are new to GitHub, you might start with a [basic tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) and check out a more detailed guide to [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).)

If you would like to propose a significant change, please open an issue first to discuss the need for change, and also the proposed changes to avoid re-work.

Pull requests will be evaluated by the maintainers on a schedule and if deemed beneficial will be committed to the master. Pull requests should have a descriptive name and include an summary of all changes made in the pull request description. We use either 'Squash & Merge' or 'Rebase & Merge' policy most of the time.

All contributors retain the original copyright to their stuff, but by contributing to this project, you are agreeing to the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) of the project.
