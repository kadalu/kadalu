## How to contribute

You are encouraged to contribute to the repository by **forking and submitting a pull request**.

(If you are new to GitHub, you might start with a [basic tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) and check out a more detailed guide to [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).)

### Major Enhancements

If you would like to propose a significant change, it is required to open a [RFC request](https://github.com/kadalu/rfcs) first. This process is required for making sure the community and the architects are in agreement of new changes. This saves time for everyone involved.

### Bugs and minor changes

If the work you want to do is minor enhancement, or a bug fix, it is fine to open an issue, and assign it to yourself to start contributing.


### Process of review

Pull requests will be evaluated by the maintainers on a schedule and if deemed beneficial will be committed to the master. Pull requests should have a descriptive name and include an summary of all changes made in the pull request description. We use either 'Squash & Merge' or 'Rebase & Merge' policy most of the time.
