## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.0] - 2020-05-11
### Added
- New documentation added for Storage Classes
- Kadalu can be used as Local storage with the introduction of new
  Storage Class filter `node_affinity`.
- Experimental Arm support added with separate tag `master.`
- Python 2 support for Kadalu Kubectl extension
- Added support for Kubernetes 1.18
- Kadalu Server and CSI container images are upgraded to the latest
  stable release of Gluster(7.4).
- Fixed an issue of Server pods not starting due to long
  names. Removed hostname identifier from the Server pod names so that
  the Server pod name length will be well within limits. Use `kubectl
  get pods -n kadalu -o wide` to see the hostnames.

## [0.6.0] - 2020-03-01
### Added
- Replica 2 support added using the Thin arbiter feature of GlusterFS
- Fixed issue showing the wrong status of server Pod as "Running"
  instead of the actual error.
- Fixed Gluster remount failure, when connectivity with storage pods
  goes down, and `df` command doesn't show the Gluster mount.
- CSI provisioner is enhanced to choose available storages randomly to
  avoid retrying with the same storage pool if that is down. This
  method also helps to utilize all the available storage pool for
  PVs.
- Fixed permissions issue when app pods try to use mounted PVs with a
  non-root user.
- Kadalu base container image upgraded to Fedora 31 and Gluster
  version in server and CSI container images to 7.3.
- Fixed issue in kubectl kadalu plugin while parsing arguments related
  to external storage and Tiebreaker node.

  0.4.0(Kubectl plugin, External storage, and Storage configurations)
- Cleanup script enhanced to handle CSIDriver object, which was
  introduced in the latest version of Kubernetes.
- Troubleshooting documentation is added.

  mounting the Storage pool to avoid race conditions when PV claim and
  pod create done in parallel.
- All Pylint tests are now passing.
- Upgraded Kadalu Server container images to Gluster latest
  release(7.x)

### Added
- Enhancement to support Kadalu storage on top of existing PVC

- Added sidecar container to capture logs from the mount processes
  in CSI pods.
- `kadalu-quotad` is now available as pypi package to use with
  external Gluster Volumes.
- Deploy attacher as a container in provisioner statefulset instead of
